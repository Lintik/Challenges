You are given two different points on a plane. Each point has its own initial coordinates and own velocity vector (in some units per second). The points start moving with given velocities at the same moment in time. Will they collide?

* __[time limit] 3000ms (cs)__
* __[input] array.integer p__ <br /><br />coordinates of the first point in the form [X, Y]

* __[input] array.integer q__ <br /><br />coordinates of the second point in the form [X, Y]

* __[input] array.integer u__<br /><br />velocity of the first point in the form [Vx, Vy]

* __[input] array.integer v__<br /><br />velocity of the second point in the form [Vx, Vy]

* __[output] boolean__<br /><br />true if the points will have the same coordinates at some point in time, false otherwise
